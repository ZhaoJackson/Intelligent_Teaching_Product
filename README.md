## Data Structure

The dashboard uses three main datasets:

### Students Dataset (`data/students.csv`)
- **80 student profiles** with realistic diversity
- Personality types, technical skills, collaboration scores
- Learning preferences and availability patterns
- Academic performance and engagement metrics

### Groups Dataset (`data/groups.csv`)
- **20 group compositions** with 4 students each
- Risk assessment levels (Low, Medium, High)
- Progress tracking and meeting patterns
- Project topics and documentation quality

### Interactions Dataset (`data/interactions.csv`)
- **500+ interaction records** between students
- Communication patterns and collaboration quality
- Meeting histories and follow-up requirements
- Topic-specific discussion tracking

## Theoretical Framework

### Social Psychology Principles
- **Social Identity Theory**: Understanding group belonging and dynamics
- **Trust Building**: Creating psychological safety in teams
- **Communication Styles**: Matching compatible interaction preferences
- **Conflict Resolution**: Early intervention strategies based on behavioral patterns

### AI Enhancement Strategies
1. **Assessment Phase**: Personality profiling, skill assessment, learning style analysis
